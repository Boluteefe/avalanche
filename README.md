# Functions and Errors

## Auction Smart Contract

This smart contract represents a simple auction system where participants can place bids, and the highest bidder can end or cancel the auction.

## Contract Details

- **Auctioneer:** The creator of the auction, who has special privileges.
- **Highest Bidder:** The address of the participant with the highest bid.
- **Highest Bid:** The current highest bid amount.
- **Auction State:** Indicates whether the auction is open or closed.

## Functions

### `endAuction()`

## Modifiers

- **`onlyAuctioneer`**: Ensures that only the auctioneer can call certain functions.
- **`auctionOpen`**: Ensures that the auction is still open before allowing certain actions.

## Error Handling

- The contract uses `require()` for conditions that participants should adhere to.
- The contract uses `revert()` for scenarios where a transaction must be reverted with a custom error message.
- The contract uses `assert()` for conditions that should never be false and to ensure the correctness of the code.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract to a compatible Ethereum network.
2. Interact with the contract using a web3-enabled application or command-line tools.
3. Follow the provided functions and modifiers to conduct an auction.

## Notes
